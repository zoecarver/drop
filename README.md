# Drop
Drop is a simple physics simulator I am writing for educational purposes.

## Install
All the frameworks that are needed should already be in this repo so you can just open the xcode project and run it. 

## Constrols
Check `basicblock` for more info on the controls but the basic idea is to use your arrow keys.

## TODO
- [ ] Makefile
- [ ] Better Controlls
- [ ] Debugging
